<h1>Welcome to Konstitusyon: A New Vision for the Filipino Nation</h1>

<p>The 1987 Philippine Constitution was born out of a pivotal moment in history — but decades later time has revealed its inherent flaws. What was once a promise of freedom and reform has too often become a barrier to real progress, equitable representation, and the full expression of our natural rights as human beings. This site exists because the time has come to imagine a new constitutional foundation — one that reflects a truly representative democracy, empowers every Filipino, and enshrines the natural rights that no government should ever deny. Konstitusyon is a space for discussion, education, and action—toward a future where our Constitution serves the people, not just the powerful.
</p>

<p>Calls for change have grown louder, yet past attempts to amend or replace the Constitution have failed—often because Filipinos were left in the dark about what those changes would mean. This site was created to change that. RebuildPH offers a clear, transparent, and principled proposal for a new Constitution—one grounded in natural rights, genuine representative democracy, and a fairer foundation for all. We believe that real reform begins with trust, and trust begins with openness. Here, you can explore the ideas, understand the changes, and join the conversation about building a better future for the Philippines.</p>
