Welcome to Konstitusyon: A New Vision for the Filipino Nation

The 1987 Philippine Constitution was born out of a pivotal moment in history — but decades later time has revealed its inherent flaws. What was once a promise of freedom and reform has too often become a barrier to real progress, equitable representation, and the full expression of our natural rights as human beings. This site exists because the time has come to imagine a new constitutional foundation — one that reflects a truly representative democracy, empowers every Filipino, and enshrines the natural rights that no government should ever deny. Konstitusyon is a space for discussion, education, and action—toward a future where our Constitution serves the people, not just the powerful.
